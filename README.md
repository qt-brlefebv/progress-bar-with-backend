This project builds upon the "ProgressBar" example provided with Qt Design Studio,
by introducing a C++ backend to supply the progress datum to one of the three progress bars.
It is intended to demonstrate the minimum viable infrastructure for wiring a C++-based library 
into a Qt/QML app.

The initial commit is identical to the source as pulled from the Qt Design Studio examples 
directory. You can compare it to the HEAD commit to see what was added/changed.
